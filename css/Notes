Memory-Game.html is now the most recent version
and synched with MemoryGame.js and memory-game.css


Inside setTimeout function....
if you use Function, you hav to end the function with .bind(this)
If you use '=>', you do not need to include .bind(this). it automatically binds it to the current scope.
